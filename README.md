# blink-drummer
Solenoid with blink sensor for inclusive music workshops, starting from idea by Conrad Popko (RadOrbis Percussion) and prototyped at an Education Makers jam at Milieux Participatory Media cluster in Montreal. The sensor should be mounted onto a pair of glasses or similar holder (we used velcro for this to work from the side of the frame, Conrad is currently working by screwing it onto an old frame so this points directly at the eye).  We need to confirm safety concerns for the infra-red light but this seems OK from quick research online.

Initial prototype used a battery-powered solenoid with a TIP120 transistor, Ann-Louise Davidson added the relay to work with higher voltages.
